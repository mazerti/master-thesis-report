DiVA is limited to â‰ˆ1 GB for each supporting file. If you have very large amounts of supporting material, you will probably want to use one of the data repositories. For additional help with this, contact KTH Library via researchdata@kth.se.
As of Spring 2024, there are plans to migrate this supporting data from DiVA to a research data repository.
