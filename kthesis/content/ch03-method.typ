= Method

This chapter is about Engineering-related content, Methodologies and Methods.
Use a self-explaining title.
The contents and structure of this chapter will change with your choice of methodology and methods.

Describe the engineering-related contents (preferably with models) and the research methodology and methods that are used in the degree project.
Give a theoretical description of the scientific or engineering methodology you are going to use and why have you chosen this method.
What other methods did you consider and why did you reject them? In this chapter, you describe what engineering-related and scientific skills you are going to apply, such as modeling, analyzing, developing, and evaluating engineering-related and scientific content.
The choice of these methods should be appropriate for the problem.
Additionally, you should be conscious of aspects relating to society and ethics (if applicable).
The choices should also reflect your goals and what you (or someone else) should be able to do as a result of your solution - which could not be done well before you started.

=== Validity and Reliability of methods
How will you know if your results are valid?
Remember that validity is about the accuracy of a measurement while reliability is about the consistency of the measurement values under the same conditions (i.e., repeatability).

== Datasets

- we use Wikipedia, reddit, lastfm
- describe Datasets
- reddit is a bigger Wikipedia
- lastfm is on the next level of bigness
